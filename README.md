A command line timer for a tea brewing with small eye candies

#### Note
Notifications are provided by [go-notify](github.com/mqu/go-notify "go-notify"). On my system it's using notify-osd, which was showing the pop up on a very awkward place (*almost* top-right on second monitor). See [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/128474/how-to-customize-on-screen-notifications "Ask Ubuntu") for details on how to move the dialog.
